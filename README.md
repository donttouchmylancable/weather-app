Weather-App
---
This is my first time using api's and asyn in javascript.  
This is a simple weather app that displays the weather situation and feeds the weather description into the Giphy api so a hopefully matching GIF is shown.  
You can use the searchbar to input your city. There is no autocomplete.  
I was on vacation, so Botosani in Romania is the default city when the page loads.
